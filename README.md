# Chicken's Crappy Cheat Menu
Hi, I'm DaChickenKing. I made this cheat menu because I want Prodigy to make an anti-cheat. My purpose of making this cheat menu is aligned with the purpose of [ProdigyMathGameHacking](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking).

## Disclaimers
Similarily to ProdigyMathGameHacking:
- Prodigy states that hacks download "malware", "spyware", or "viruses" on your computer. This is false. You may scan this repoistory with a software such as [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com) or even your computer's anti-virus if you don't trust this project. **However, never give anybody your account password, and always use these cheats on an alt. Prodigy is able to delete accounts and these hacks may corrupt your user data if used wrong.**
- The ProdigyMathGameHacking [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies.
- I am not liable for any damages of any kind, as the license of this repository states:

> **7. Limitation of Liability** Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

## How to Use
- Follow the [instructions to run the ProdigyMathGameHacking Redirect Hack](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/Redirect-Hack).
- Log in to Prodigy and wait for the game to load.
- Paste the code from the `loader.js` file into the console. For instructions on how to open the console, see [this](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/How-to-use-Javascript-Hacks).
- Success!

## Notes
- Will's Cheat Menu (the default menu included with the Redirect Hack) will no longer be functional when using this menu. To use Will's Cheat Menu, close this cheat menu.
